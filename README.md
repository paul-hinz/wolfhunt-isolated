# Isolated part of the detailed wolf hunt from EINP MARS Model.

The EINP Model is a simple [MARS](https://www.mars-group.org/docs/tutorial/intro#what-is-mars) model that simmulates the bison, elk and moose population of Elk Island National Park.
This project focuses on the movements of wolfs during the hunt, which is also found in the base model.
But for better and easier analysis this project just simulates the hunt and ignores everything else, while keeping the same base structure.
